here are some words and phrases
to expand the language model's possible words
this reduces the false positive rate of the model
without these extra useless words
if the operator says something outside
of this lanugage model
it will do its best to shoehorn the
spoken phrase into something
that it is familiar with
that is why I am training the model
with all of this irrelevant stuff
it needs to be able to recognize things that
have nothing to do with the task at hand
I can type whatever I want here
doesn't matter what I write as long as it's English
below are some filler words
um
umm

I'm gonna list a couple of fruits here
apricot
apple
banana
orange
pear
my favorite fruit is banana
maybe we should train the arm to
peel a banana
that would need two arms though and
I don't know if we're still doing that
we could also have it cut an apple or something
it would be dangerous but also very fun
on second thought it might raise ethical concerns
what if the robot stabbed someone
that would be on our conscience
and our robot would forever live in infamy
so maybe we shouldn't have the robot use a knife
nice
good job
fantastic
cool
